# NICEMC playground

This project is a re-write of original [NICEMC program](https://github.com/ermongroup/a-nice-mc).

## Current Status

HMC and MH work fine.

NICE-MC may have some problems, but still yields right result for at least Ring2D model(with mean ~0, std ~1.456). And training does improve it's performance but acceptance ratio seemed stuck at 48% somehow(with original program at ~60%).
